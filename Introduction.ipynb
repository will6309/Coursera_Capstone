People visit or migrate there may from anywhere in the world.  I found that food can reflect where people are from. So we would like to explore different foods in different neighborhoods by studying what kind of restaurant is the most popular in each neighborhood. This work may help people select which neighborhood they want to live just based on their tastes."
